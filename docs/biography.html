                Cameron Manavian is the Chief Technology Officer of Libretto, where he provides technical expertise
                for applications at scale. He subscribes to quality in code ensuring that the way Libretto&apos;s
                software
                is structured is reflected in how it is built. He works closely with the rest of the team to
                make sure Libretto&apos;s technology strategy reflects the needs of advisors and their clients.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cameron has more than 15 years of software engineering and web application experience, ranging from
                secure
                eCommerce platforms, ultra-high traffic entertainment websites, big-data processing and native mobile
                applications and video games.
            </p>
            <p>
                Formerly in a position at Maker Studios, Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media from
                2015-2017, Cameron led a team of engineers by fostering architecture discussion, test-driven
                development,
                behavior-driven development and static code analysis. There he also enhanced security via suspicious
                anomaly detection, logging and prevention. Additionally, he and his team worked to integrate Salesforce
                with finance, sales and end-clients into a single portal.
            </p>
            <p>
                In his prior role at StudyMode Inc. from 2014-2015, Cameron refined text processing in order
                to identify quality documents by utilizing a mixture of proprietary algorithms
                alongside established readability tools like the Fleschâ€“Kincaid Grade Level Formula and Coleman-Liau
                index.
            </p>
            <p>
                From 2010-2014, Cameron worked at Disney ABC Television Group on high-traffic, high performance web
                applications and APIs serving millions of users per minute. Working with back-end architecture,
                front-end applications and streaming long-form, short-form and advertisement content via
                Flash/HTML5-based video players contributed to Cameron&apos;s background in creating apps that scale.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before working at Disney, Cameron worked on Speedo USA&apos;s and Calvin Klein&apos;s eCommerce
                platforms and has produced more than 50 freelance and open-source projects over the last 15 years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cameron recently taught a new generation of engineers at UCLA Extension in his free time. He loves
                interacting with the software development community via meetups and conferences, both as an attendee and
                as
                a speaker.
